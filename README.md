# HBR - These 3 Personality Traits Affect What You Earn — but Only After Age 40
- We often hear about the power of personality in shaping our careers — how some traits are beneficial while others are more harmful. But it is less clear when personality traits matter most and who benefits most from them. A recent paper investigates this by looking at the connection between personality traits and lifetime earnings among men at different ages. It finds that men’s earnings are not affected by personality at all in the beginning of their careers, but that men who are more conscientious (wishing to do one's work well and thoroughly) and extroverted, as well as less agreeable, reap large benefits between their 40s and 60s. The evidence also points to a subgroup of men who benefit from these traits more than twice as much as others: those with a graduate education.

# About Confiz - Kashif Manzoor’s video
“I was fortunate to be paid to do something that I would have gladly done for free.”
The whole gamete (a cell which is able to unite another opposite cell) of IT industry, I have dabbled (take part in an activity in a superficial way) in all of them.
Every challenge becomes exceedingly difficult. And, the potpourri (a mixture of dried petals in a bowl to perfume a room) of feelings when you are confronted with that challenge. The feeling of inadequacy and fear whether we would be able to handle that challenge or not. And the burden of responsibility that losing is not an option, running away from the challenge is not an option. All of this motivates me. 
If I have to pick one thing that drives me to success at the end of the tunnel. That one thing is that I have never really considered myself working for a company/employer. I have always thought that I am working for myself. Because at the end of the day it’s me that needs to improve. And don’t get me wrong, working for myself doesn’t mean that I am selfish. It means that I am constantly trying to be better than what I was yesterday.
And one thing that I have vehemently (forcefully) tried to protect is that inner curious child within me. Because the IT field changes so fast and if you want to be able to manage smart engineers. You cannot manage them properly unless you truly empathise with them. And once you start empathising with them you have to understand the technology that they are working with. 
It’s hard for me to learn new technologies but that does not stop me from making an effort. I don’t want to be a best coder in React-JS but I must know enough to be able to appreciate the difficulty of that technology because once I know that only then can I empathise with the customer’s challenge and also with our engineer’s challenge as well.
I also find lot of peace and wisdom in reading books. One thing that I have find whenever I read a new book is “how little I know”. You really cannot be a great professional unless you develop this habit of reading books belonging to multiple areas. And once you develop that habit, it not only grounds you (teaches you in particular area), I think it makes you wiser. But as you become wiser, you realise that how lack of wisdom you have. 
Processes are the backbone of any great organization. Process is meant to empower individuals so that they consistently deliver excellent quality work that delights the customer. To create processes that enhances our engineering excellence, that empowers our individuals, that cherishes their creativity and innovation. So, I would always pick warriors. I think it really doesn’t matter you win or lose. It’s how bravely you fought the war, how skilled you were in fighting the war and winning is just having to be the by-product of how good a warrior you are. And we also have to learn and remember that warriors are not just born. You have to create the culture in your organization that breeds the warrior with in. A culture that encourages free thinking, where people are open to criticise respectfully and also accept positive criticism as well and take that criticism to be a better version of themselves. 
Cloud, Artificial Intelligence, IOT is going to rule the near future of IT landscape. I think it would be very presumptuous of me or anyone else in the IT industry to make sweeping statements about how the future of IT industry would look like. 
How do you prepare for a future that you are unwilling to predict? You can be assured that your tomorrow is going to look drastically different than your today because your today was drastically different than your yesterday. So therefore as a company we go through lot of pains to make sure that our team is prepared to embrace the change when it happens. 
The advice that I would give to myself, youngsters and veterans (a person who has had long experience in particular field) of this field every day is to make career decisions to work hard only to aspire to have that kind of passion in your field. Once you have that passion, it’s such a wonderful feeling, it’s an intoxicating feeling and only then the real magic starts.

# Satya Nadella email to employees on first day as CEO – Few points
Today is a very humbling day for me. It reminds me of my very first day at Microsoft, 22 years ago.
It is an incredible honour for me to lead and serve this great company of ours. I have been fortunate to work closely with both Bill and Steve in my different roles at Microsoft.  
Our industry does not respect tradition – it only respects innovation.
I am 46. I have been married for 22 years and we have 3 kids. And like anyone else, a lot of what I do and how I think has been shaped by my family and my overall life experiences. I buy more books than I can finish. I signed up for more courses than I can complete. Family, curiosity and hunger for knowledge all define me.
I believe over the next decade computing will become even more ubiquitous and intelligence will become ambient (related to the immediate surrounding of something).
This is a software-powered world. 
We need to believe in the impossible and remove the improbable (not likely to be true or to happen). This starts with clarity of purpose and sense of mission that will lead us to imagine the impossible and deliver it.
The best work happens when you know that it’s not just work, but something that will improve other people’s lives. 
Many companies aspire (direct one’s hopes towards achieving success) to change the world. But very few have all the elements required: talent, resources, and perseverance (persistence in doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving success).

# HBR - How to build a great relationship with a mentor?
People with mentors perform better, advance in their careers faster, and even experience more work-life satisfaction. And mentors benefit, too. After all, “to teach is to learn twice.”
The following eight steps can help to find a mentor or establish a relationship:
1.	Define your goals and specific needs.
Get out a pen and paper, and write out your career goals. Then, list out some of the biggest obstacles to achieving them. This specificity will help you decide what type of mentor you should be looking for.
2.	Write the “job description” of your ideal mentor.
3.	Search for mentors through second-degree network.
Mentors can be from anywhere. 
4.	Make the ask (and keep it simple).
Asking someone to be your mentor the first time, second time, and even third time is a little awkward. It’s likely you’ve never been asked to mentor someone else, nor taught how to make the ask for yourself. Embrace (hold someone closely in one’s arms, accept willingly) the uncomfortable feeling and be vulnerable (exposed to the possibility of being attacked or harmed). Ask someone for a first conversation to learn more about their work and interests. Once you learn more about each other, if there is an alignment, then make the bigger ask for mentorship.
5.	Have a first meeting.
You have two goals for your first conversation with your potential mentor. First, you need to determine if this person is really the right mentor for you. Then, find out whether they are open to the idea of mentoring you. 
How to approach the conversation?
-	Make it easy for the person. Go to a location convenient for them, have a tea waiting, come prepared, and make the meeting no-pressure and comfortable.
-	Spend time getting to know the person. Talk less than 30% of your time.
-	It’s okay for to ask for small favours out of the gate (immediately from the start). In fact, it might even help you build the relationship.
-	Make a clear ask: “I’ve really enjoyed this conversation. Would it be okay if I followed up with you again in one month after I make some progress towards my goals?”
-	Say thank you, and then follow-up again over email to say thank you again.
6.	Start simply.
For your next meeting, keep it simple and follow-up based on your last encounter. Once the person confirms they will meet with you again, send an email proposing an agenda and hinting at the idea of a longer-term relationship. Something like: “In our next chat, I hope we have a quick catch-up, and then I’d love to further expand on our conversation from last time. I’ll come prepared with some specific questions that I think you could help me answer.”
7.	Create a structured accountability process with a mentorship agreement.
After you have a simple conversation or two, try making a more formal ask: Would the person be willing to sit down with you once a month for the next six months until you achieve your goal or solve your problem? If so, then consider creating a simple one-page document outlining what you will accomplish in those six months together. While it might seem a bit overkill, it will help add clarity to you and to your mentor by helping share the goal of the relationship. It will also help you set a clear agenda for each meeting. You can suggest it by saying: “I truly appreciate your time, and I really want to make sure I’m making the most of it. I was thinking that I could prepare a simple document that would share my goals with you, my commitment to you, and what milestones I hope to achieve in the next three months. I think it will help hold me accountable to come prepared to our conversations. Would you be okay with that?”
8.	Continue to follow-up and say thank you.
You should definitely send a thank-you note after every meeting. Beyond that, once your mentorship arrangement comes to a close, you should continue to say thanks. So remember, it’s okay to ask for a favour, just make sure to show proper appreciation!

# HBR - Plan a better meeting with Design Thinking
Design Thinking – The idea is to put the “user” at the centre of the experience.
Start by putting your own expertise and agenda aside and thinking about the people who will be affected by your meeting. Develop empathy (ability to understand other’s feelings) for them by asking three sets of questions:
1.	Who is going to be in the room and what are their needs?
2.	Who won’t be in the room but will nevertheless (but, iss k bawajood) be affected by the meeting and what are their needs?
3.	In what broader culture and environment are you operating and what are some of the overarching (comprehensive) challenges and opportunities?
Actively seek out individuals who will attend the meeting, or who will be affected by it, and speak with them — ideally in person. Individual brief check-ins can help build trust, surfaces hidden issues and ensures that participants feel more invested.
Next, set a frame for the meeting. We recommend that you ask yourself: If this meeting is wildly successful, what will people feel, know, and do as a result? Include these desired outcomes in your agenda. Even — perhaps (probably, shaayad) especially — Short meetings deserve a clear purpose and clearly articulated desired outcomes.
The third step is to creatively design the meeting. Once you know the core question to address, and what success might look like, you should create your agenda. Meetings are opportunities not simply to get things done, but also foster a positive team culture.
People who have applied this design process to their meetings tell us that it has radically affected both the efficacy (the ability to produce a desired result) of those gatherings, and the attitude people in their organizations have about them.
Immersing helps people feel heard, and it ensures that meeting leaders are connected to participants. Framing pushes the meeting leaders to ensure that there are clear goals for each meeting. Imagining leads to more creativity and experimentation in the meeting design. Finally, prototyping—something as simple as getting feedback on your plan from a few people — makes people feel valued, more accountable in the meetings, and more invested in their success.
This may seem onerous for every meeting but, with practice, you can learn to cycle through these stages in less and less time, and you’ll find that small investment upfront saves significant time in the long run. You’ll have fewer meetings, and those you do have will be more productive — even sometimes fun.

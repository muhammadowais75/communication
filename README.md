- There is distortion in your voice.
- Let me quickly open the sheet.
- This is supposed to be checked out on our side.
- We have tentative plans for the weekend (the plans which are not final).
  The commetti reached a tentative agreement (an agreement that is not final).
  Why are you so tentative (unconfirmed / not sure) about this.
- There is a distortion in your voice.
- Am I audible / Can you hear me.
- Can you see my screen now.
- That makes sense.
- Fair enough.
- How can I help you?
- Mustafa once said:
  You have cut the vein which brings life to our call.
- It is a glitch (minor malfunction).
- Hope you are doing well.
- No worries at all.
